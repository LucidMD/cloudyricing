# Cloudy Ricing
This is a repository of all my dotfiles for my WM Ricing Experiments, I plan to release a script in the future that will make the installation easier, with multiple choices for colors and dependencies, that would work on multiple distros

Current Window Managers Planned to be Riced:

- Mutter
- Awesome
- Qtile
- FluxBox
- dwm

They will be done in the order they are listed, cherry picked from a spinning wheel
